    <h1>Sea Life</h1>
        <div class="container1">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Marine life, sea life, or ocean life is the plants, animals, and other organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms, mostly microorganisms, produce oxygen and sequester carbon. Marine life in part shape and protect shorelines, and some marine organisms even help create new land (e.g. coral building reefs). Most life forms evolved initially in marine habitats. By volume, oceans provide about 90% of the living space on the planet.[2] The earliest vertebrates appeared in the form of fish,[3] which live exclusively in water. Some of these evolved into amphibians, which spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Other fish evolved into land mammals and subsequently returned to the ocean as seals, dolphins, or whales. Plant forms such as kelp and other algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. Plankton forms the general foundation of the ocean food chain, particularly phytoplankton which are key primary producers</p>

         <h2>Different Sea Creatures</h2>
        <p>There are many different sea creatures from microorganisms to blue whales. These creatures play a fundemental role in our environment. Some of the common sea creatures are listed below.</p>        
            <ul> <li>
                    Crab
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fish
                </li>
                <li>
                    Octopus
                </li>
                <li>
                    Seal
                </li>
                <li>
                    Jellyfish
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="container3">
            <h2>Threat to sea life</h2>
            <p>There are many threats to our sea life. One of the most common threat to our sea life is global warming. The increase in global warming is causing the ice capes to melt increasing the water level. Some sea creatures arer dying due to high temperature.The second most common threat to our sea life is water pollution. Water pollution includes plastic straws and other stuff.</p>

            <h2>New Discoveries</h2>
            <p>As the ocean is a very waste region there are many new discoveries over a certain period of time. Such as a sea jelly that mimics a hot air balloon,
                a sea snail species hiding in plain sight as another sea snail species, a purple and yellow tree-spider crab and a giant creature that looks just like silly string.</p>
